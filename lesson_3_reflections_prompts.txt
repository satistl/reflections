When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    - To collaborate with others
    - To access files from different computers
    - To make projects public

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling and pushing changes is interacting with the repository on GitHub.
    Like in the local repositories the content pulled and pushed should be
    meaningful. Therefore one would like to combine several commits making up
    a new feature before sharing it with others. Likewise others will be wanting
    a branch to change while they are working on it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are remote copies of remote repositories.
    Clones are local copies of remote repositories.
    Branches are a labeled chain of commits. They exist within a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
